What does the word 'polymorphism' mean?
  Polymorphism is the ability for an object to take on many forms.

What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.
When a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object. Creating an Arraylist of Vehicle parent class to allow passing in different child classes of vehicles.

What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?
Interfaces and Abstract/ Super classes

How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?
As many interfaces as it implements and the class itself and parent Super class.

Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.
Creating an Arraylist of Vehicle parent class to allow passing in different child classes of vehicles.

What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?
Composition is a design technique used to implement a has-a relations. e.g a Person has a Job.

When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.

What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition
It is loosely coupled compared to tightly coupled like inheritance.
Since we choose which methods can be accessed it is more secure than inheritance.
